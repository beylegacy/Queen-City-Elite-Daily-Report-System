I need to add a Company Newsletter & Announcements section to my Queen City Elite Front Desk application. This feature should help build morale and trust by keeping all properties informed about company updates and important announcements.
Requirements:
1. Newsletter/Announcements Page:

Create a dedicated page accessible from the main navigation
Display announcements in reverse chronological order (newest first)
Each announcement should include:

Title/headline
Date posted
Category/type (e.g., Company Update, Recognition, Policy Change, Event, Celebration)
Full announcement text with formatting support
Author/posted by (e.g., "QCE Management" or specific person's name)
Optional: attached image or photo



2. Admin Panel for Creating Announcements:

Secure admin-only section for creating and managing announcements
Form fields for:

Title
Category dropdown
Announcement text (with basic formatting options like bold, bullets, links)
Image upload (optional)
Date (auto-populate with current date, but allow editing for scheduling)
Visibility toggle (draft vs. published)


Ability to edit or delete existing announcements
Preview function before publishing

3. User Experience Features:

Highlight new/unread announcements (perhaps with a "NEW" badge for posts from last 7 days)
Archive older announcements (maybe after 90 days) but keep them accessible
Search/filter functionality by category or date range
Mobile-responsive design since front desk staff use various devices

4. Visual Design:

Use Queen City Elite branding colors
Make it visually appealing and engaging
Consider using icons for different announcement categories
Ensure good readability with appropriate font sizes and spacing

5. Additional Features to Consider:

Email notification option when new announcements are posted (optional)
Comment section for staff feedback (if appropriate)
"Pinned" announcement feature for critical/ongoing information
Counter showing number of new announcements since last login

Technical Considerations:

Store announcements in the database with appropriate schema
Ensure proper authentication so only authorized users can create/edit
All properties should see the same announcements (company-wide visibility)
Optimize images for web to maintain performance
Include timestamp tracking for created/modified dates

Integration with Existing App:

Add a navigation link in the main menu (e.g., "Company News" or "Announcements")
Consider adding a notification badge on the nav link when there are new posts
Ensure consistent styling with the existing Front Desk Daily Report System

Example Use Cases:

Announcing new hires or promotions
Celebrating team achievements or milestones
Sharing policy updates or procedural changes
Promoting company events or team-building activities
Recognizing outstanding performance from specific properties
Sharing grant success or company growth news
Holiday schedules or important dates

Please implement this feature with clean, maintainable code and ensure it integrates smoothly with the existing application structure.
