🧩 The Problems

Shift Report Data Loss

Current issue: When an agent refreshes the page or a shift changes, the shift report data is erased.

What I need:

Implement persistent data storage using Replit DB, SQLite, or Firebase (whichever integrates easiest).

Reports should be saved and reloaded automatically based on the combination of:

Property name

Date

Shift

When a user logs in or selects a shift, the most recent report for that property should load automatically.

The app must not clear data on page reload or shift switch.

Package Tracking Is Too Complicated

I need a simpler workflow.

Add functionality to auto-populate resident details:

When a user types in an apartment number, the system should automatically fill in the resident’s name, email, and phone.

The resident data should be stored in a simple database or JSON file that can be updated via the manager dashboard.

Manager Section Lacks Core Controls
Add the following CRUD functionality for the Manager role:

Property Management

Add or delete properties.

Daily Task Management

Add or edit daily tasks assigned to each property.

Email Notification Settings

Add, remove, or edit the list of emails that receive reports for each property.

All manager changes should be saved persistently (not lost on page refresh).

🧠 Technical Requirements

Ensure all new data (reports, residents, properties, tasks, emails) are stored in persistent storage.

Keep the UI simple and easy to use — especially for front desk agents.

Maintain existing authentication or role separation if it already exists (agents vs. managers).

Minimize reloads — use AJAX or Fetch for background saves when possible.

Use clean modular code (React, Flask, Node, or whichever stack this project already uses).

✅ Expected Behavior After Fixes

Shift reports persist through refreshes and are retrievable by property/date/shift.

Package tracking auto-fills resident info when apartment number is entered.

Managers can dynamically manage:

Properties

Daily tasks

Notification emails

All data changes persist after reloads or logouts.

💡 (Optional Enhancements if Time Allows)

Add an “Activity Log” showing which user made which updates.

Add export functionality for daily reports (CSV or PDF).

Add a visible confirmation message when data is successfully saved.

Goal: Upgrade the Queen City Elite Daily Report System into a stable, persistent, and manager-configurable tool that can be used reliably across multiple properties and shifts.
