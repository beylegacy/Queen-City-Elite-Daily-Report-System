I need to fix several issues with the Queen City Elite Daily Report System:
Issue 1: Auto-Send Report Not Working
The shift report is not automatically sending at the end of each shift. Please review and fix the auto-send functionality so that:

Reports are automatically emailed to designated managers when a shift ends (or at scheduled times: 7am, 3pm, 11pm)
Include a manual "Send Report" button as a backup
Confirm the email configuration is correct and test the send function

Issue 2: Shift Handoff/Reset Not Working
When a new shift starts, the previous shift's information is still displayed and the new shift person cannot start fresh. Please fix so that:

When a shift ends (either by time or manual close), the system archives that shift's data
A new shift automatically initializes with a clean slate for the incoming employee
Previous shift data is saved/stored but cleared from the active entry form
The new shift person can enter their name and start logging fresh while still having access to view the previous shift's notes if needed for continuity

Issue 3: "View Details" Button Not Working on Home Page
The home page shows 1st, 2nd, and 3rd shift sections, but clicking "View Details" does nothing. Please fix so that:

Clicking "View Details" opens/expands to show that shift's logged information
If no data has been entered yet, display a message like "No activity logged for this shift yet"
Ensure the buttons are properly linked to pull the correct shift data

Issue 4: Add Home Navigation Icon to Manager Login Page
Once a manager logs in, there's no way to navigate back to the home/dashboard. Please add:

A home icon (house icon) in the header/navigation area of the manager pages
Clicking it should return the manager to the main dashboard
Make sure it's visible on all manager-accessible pages

Issue 5: Link Manager Login to Company News Section
Create functionality so managers (or designated users) can post company updates and newsletters:

Add a "Company News" or "Announcements" section accessible from the manager dashboard
Allow managers to create, edit, and delete news posts/updates
Display these announcements on the front desk employee's home screen so they see company news when they log in
Include fields for: Title, Message Body, Date Posted, Posted By
Show newest announcements at the top


Let me know if you need me to clarify any of these requirements or break them into smaller tasks!
