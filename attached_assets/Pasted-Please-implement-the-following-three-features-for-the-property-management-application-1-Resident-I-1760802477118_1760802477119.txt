Please implement the following three features for the property management application:
1. Resident Import via Spreadsheet
Add functionality to import current residents for each property through spreadsheet upload:

Allow CSV/Excel file upload for bulk resident import
Flexible column mapping: Support flexible spreadsheet formats since different properties may provide different data
Recommended columns include: Unit Number, Resident Name, Move-in Date, Lease End Date, Email, Phone Number
Only Unit Number and Resident Name should be required fields - all other fields are optional
Provide column mapping interface where user can match their spreadsheet columns to system fields
Handle missing/optional data gracefully - import should succeed even with partial information
Validate data that IS provided (check date formats for dates, email formats for emails, etc.)
Show preview of data before final import with ability to review and correct errors
Associate imported residents with the specific property being managed
Handle duplicate entries gracefully (offer options to skip, update, or merge)
Provide success/error summary after import completion showing what was imported and what was skipped

2. Agent Name by Shift
Modify the agent/staff assignment system to support different agent names per shift:

Allow setting different agent names for each shift (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
Store agent name configurations per property
Display the appropriate agent name based on current time/active shift
Include UI for managers to configure agent names for each shift in property settings
Ensure agent name updates reflect immediately in the resident-facing portal

3. Daily Email Distribution List
Add email notification system with property-specific recipient lists:

Allow managers to configure a list of email addresses for each property
Add interface to add/remove/edit email recipients per property
Implement daily automated email sending at a configurable time
Email should include relevant daily summary/reports for that property
Include email delivery status/logs for troubleshooting
Provide option to manually trigger test emails

Technical Considerations:

Ensure all features have proper authentication and authorization (only property managers can access these functions)
Add appropriate error handling and user feedback
Make UI intuitive and mobile-responsive
Consider data privacy and security for resident information
